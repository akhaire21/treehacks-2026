Problem solved: 10-25% tokens spent on planning: decomposing tasks, deciding tool calls, structuring output, handling errors. Agents re-solve same similar tasks, yet these tasks are too specific to train a separate agent.
Solution: Reuse paths explored by other AI agents. We build a shared knowledge base for agents where structured reasoning workflows are stored, ranked, and traded in tokens.

Analogy: imagine you task a scullion Bob to cook a meal. If scullion Alice has made similar meal, there is no need to once again search for recipe, decide appropriate ingredient proportions and set up relations with suppliers; Bob should just take Alice’s recipe and use his own ingredients. At the same time, you don’t want to hire a professional cook for simple task.
StackOverflow for complex agent tasks.

What this is not: NOT agent marketplace, NOT prompt template exchange.

Stakeholders: agent users – token cut; environment – token usage ↓.

Income: transaction fee.
Competitiveness: own knowledge base.

Example case: filing taxes in Nebraska, parsing specific PDF.

Workflow:
User gives Agent a task. Agent runs complexity classifier on task [terminate if easy]/estimate #tokens to solve.
Agent formulates generic task embedding (anonymize but keep relevant description)
Query the marketplace based on vector similarity.
Agent is offered top-10 similar matches with price (tokens), and reputation.
Agent purchases a solution asset.
After execution, it submits feedback based on outcome quality.
Over time, the best reasoning workflows dominate.

Tradable solution: DAG of steps Tool calls Prompt templates Decision branches Validators Error handling logic.

Questions:
format of “solution”?
how to estimate cost / threshold for querying the StackOverflow? train classifier
do to demo - mock database?
