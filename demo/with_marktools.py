with_marktools.py — Simulates what an agent does WITH marktools.

This is the "enhanced" agent: Claude with access to the Mark AI marketplace
via `pip install marktools`. It uses mark_estimate → mark_buy → mark_rate
to get pre-solved expert workflows with edge cases and domain knowledge.

This file is used by the demo to show the AFTER state.
